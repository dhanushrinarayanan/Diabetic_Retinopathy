# 🏥 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using ML 👁️‍🗨️

## 📌 Overview  
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, potentially leading to blindness. This project leverages **machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques** to detect and classify DR using **fundus images**. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
🔹 **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
🔹 **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras 🔬, OpenCV 📷, NumPy 🔢, Pandas 📊  
🔹 **Model Used:** **CNN, SVM, and Ensemble Learning**  
🔹 **Dataset:** Publicly available retinal image datasets 📂  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Automated DR Detection** from retinal images 👀  
✅ **Multi-Class Classification** (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative DR)  
✅ **Explainable AI (XAI) support** for better interpretability 🔍  
✅ **User-friendly UI with Gradio/Streamlit** 🎨  
✅ **Multi-Modal Fusion Approach** for improved accuracy  

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🧠
Support Vector Machine (SVM) 📈
Ensemble Learning (Hybrid Model) 🤖
📊 Sample Predictions
🔍 If DR is detected, the model classifies the severity level ⚠️
✅ If DR is not detected, the model confirms "No DR found"

## 📌 Future Enhancements
🚀 Improve accuracy with transformer-based models
📊 Add more real-world medical datasets
💡 Optimize the UI for better usability
