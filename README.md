# Diabetic_Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina)

**1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
Purpose: Used for classification tasks based on extracted features.
Role: Helps in classifying different stages of diabetic retinopathy.
**2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
Purpose: Deep learning model used for feature extraction from fundus images.
Role: Detects patterns and abnormalities in retinal images.
**3. Ensemble Learning**
Purpose: Combines multiple models to improve overall accuracy and robustness.
Role: Integrates predictions from CNN and SVM for better diagnosis.
**4. Multimodal Fusion Approach**
Purpose: Integrates fundus images and clinical parameters for improved decision-making.
Role: Enhances model performance by leveraging multiple data sources.
